### DEC-0001: SQLite checkpointing for resident agent memory

Status: approved

Context:

Product and architecture agents need to stay alive as collaborators. They may
ask follow-up questions, receive clarifications from the engineering manager,
and continue the same shaping discussion later. Stateless Deep Agents subagents
do not preserve that conversational continuity.

Decision:

Use SQLite-backed LangGraph checkpointing as the default V0 persistence layer
for the engineering manager and resident product and architecture agents. Keep a
Postgres checkpoint adapter installed and configurable for future shared or
production deployments.

Options considered:

- SQLite checkpointer
- Postgres checkpointer
- In-memory checkpointer

Consequences:

- Local CLI restarts can preserve resident product and architecture thread
  history.
- The default setup does not require provisioning external infrastructure.
- Postgres can be enabled by configuration when the system needs shared durable
  persistence.
- Versioned repository artifacts remain the source of truth for approved
  decisions and requirements.
